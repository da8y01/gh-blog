## QUOTES
David Allen’s “Getting Things Done”, or GTD for short, is a popular, powerful system for managing one’s life.

GTD is a system for managing your life: what you want to achieve, how you plan to achieve that, and how you deal with all the stuff life throws at you. You decide goals, the system helps you reach them.

You should break down the list by context or other suitable category. A context is the things that are required for you to do the action:

I feel like that every Monday morning.

I have no good solution for that, except to grow up.

The nagger remembers when you last did something, and after the specified time, it starts nagging you every day until you tell it you’ve done it again.

A calendar tells you what should happen in the future. A journal or diary tells you what you did in the past.

There are two kinds of files you need to keep track of: those related to current affairs, and those you archive for possible future use.

More important than the physical manifestation of the concept of “folder” is how you arrange them, when you have many of them.

It’s good to keep track of these things: otherwise the brain tends to keep coming back to them, so they don’t get forgotten, and that tends to waste time and energy. Keeping a list lets the brain relax.

Having routines is good, since it relieves you from having to make decisions all the time about trivial stuff. (It’s also good to break your routines every now and then, to avoid boredom.)

The weekly review is a fundamentally important part of making sure you stay on top of things.

but it also means you can continue to function normally while you do it.

You might start with just one aspect of your life.

You can deal with it by either giving up, or by taking a long time.

A single system is simpler, for me.
